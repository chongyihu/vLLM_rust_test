You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n

Expected Output Format:\n    The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\n    As an example, for the schema {{\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}} the object {{\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {{\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\n    Here is the output schema:\n\n    ```\n    {\"$defs\": {\"ReasonDetail\": {\"properties\": {\"detailed_explanation\": {\"description\": \"An in-depth explanation of why the device was flagged as vulnerable, including references to requirement documents and analysis of the specific snapshots from the device output, offering a personalized rationale to enhance user confidence in the LLM\'s assessment.\", \"title\": \"Detailed Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"relevant_device_output\": {\"description\": \"Extracted lines from the device output (+/- 2-3 lines) that contributed to the vulnerability decision, allowing the user to review the exact context.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Relevant Device Output\", \"type\": \"array\"}}, \"required\": [\"detailed_explanation\", \"relevant_device_output\"], \"title\": \"ReasonDetail\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"properties\": {\"is_vulnerable\": {\"description\": \"Indicates if the device is vulnerable (True) or not (False)\", \"title\": \"Is Vulnerable\", \"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"reason\": {\"description\": \"Explanation of why the device is flagged as vulnerable or not.\", \"title\": \"Reason\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"reason_detail\": {\"$ref\": \"#/$defs/ReasonDetail\", \"description\": \"A structured, detailed explanation of the vulnerability status, including contextual insights and specific device output lines.\"}, \"mitigation_step\": {\"description\": \"Recommended steps to mitigate the identified vulnerability based on the Requirement Document and device output.\", \"title\": \"Mitigation Step\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"is_vulnerable\", \"reason\", \"reason_detail\", \"mitigation_step\"]}\n    ```

Requirement Document: {\'category\': \'Cisco Security Advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) server implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper parsing of malformed DHCPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DHCPv6 packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak and eventual reload of an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-dhcpv6[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-dhcpv6\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: The September 24, 2014, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Individual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep14.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep14.html\"]\r\n\r\n\', \'title\': \'Summary\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'text\': \'Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software with the DHCPv6 server feature enabled are vulnerable. The DHCPv6 server feature is not enabled by default. Cisco devices that are configured as DHCPv6 clients or relay agents are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco IOS device or Cisco IOS XE device is configured as a DHCPv6 server, issue the show ipv6 dhcp interface command.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is not vulnerable because it is not configured as a DHCPv6 server:\r\n\r\nRouter#show ipv6 dhcp interface\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the DHCPv6 server feature is applied to the FastEthernet0/0 interface and DHCPv6 server pool DHCPv6-stateful is used:\r\n\r\nRouter#show ipv6 dhcp interface\r\nFastEthernet0/0 is in server mode\r\n Using pool: DHCPv6-stateful\r\n Preference value: 0\r\n Hint from client: ignored\r\n Rapid-Commit: disabled\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the DHCPv6 server feature is applied to the FastEthernet0/0 and FastEthernet0/1 interfaces:\r\n\r\nRouter#show ipv6 dhcp interface | include server\r\nFastEthernet0/0 is in server mode\r\nFastEthernet0/1 is in server mode\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software.\" The image name displays in parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\nCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\nCompiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team\r\n!--- output truncated \r\n\r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"]. \r\n\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'text\': \'Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.\', \'title\': \'Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'text\': \'The DHCPv6 Server feature in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software is a DHCPv6 server implementation that assigns and manages IPv6 addresses, prefixes, and other information from specified address pools to DHCPv6 clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) server implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper parsing of malformed DHCPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DHCPv6 packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak and eventual reload of an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is triggered when the affected Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE device attempts to process a crafted DHCPv6 packet. Valid DHCPv6 packets will not trigger this vulnerability. DHCPv6 packets that the Cisco IOS device forwards (for example, transit DHCPv6 traffic) will not trigger this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nBoth packets sent to link-scoped multicast address ff02::1:2 (All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers) and the interface IPv6 unicast address of the DHCPv6 server will trigger this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability can only be exploited via malformed IPv6 packets. Cisco IOS devices that are configured as a DHCP version 4 (DHCP) server for IP version 4 (IPv4) are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCum90081[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum90081\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only).
