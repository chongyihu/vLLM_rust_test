Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This issue was found during an investigation of a related issue reported by David Barksdale, Jordan Gruskovnjak, and Alex Wheeler of Exodus Intelligence.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version 2 (v2) fragmentation code of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated,  remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an improper handling of crafted, fragmented IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by  sending crafted UDP packets to the affected system. An exploit  could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected system.\r\n\r\nNote: Only traffic directed to the affected system can  be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and  IPv6 traffic.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.  \r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 23, 2016, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes six Cisco Security Advisories that describe six vulnerabilities. All the vulnerabilities have a Security Impact Rating of \"High.\" For a complete list of advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/event-response/cisco-erp-march-2016.html\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Affected Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects products running a vulnerable version of  Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software. For more information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software section of this advisory.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'Devices running a vulnerable version of the software are affected if the following two conditions are verified:\r\n\r\nIKEv2 fragmentation is enabled\r\nThe device is running Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software and is configured for any type of VPN based on IKEv2\r\n\r\nNote: IKEv1-based VPNs are not affected by this vulnerability; however, in some  cases, enabling IKEv1 will automatically enable IKEv2.\r\n\r\n  A number of features use IKEv2, including different types of VPNs, such as the following:\r\n\r\nLAN-to-LAN VPN\r\nRemote access VPN (excluding SSLVPN)\r\nDynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)\r\nFlexVPN\r\nGroup Encrypted Transport VPN (GETVPN)\r\n\r\nTo verify whether IKEv2 fragmentation is enabled, use the show running-config | include crypto ikev2 fragmentation command and verify that it returns output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a device running Cisco IOS Software with crypto ikev2 fragmentation enabled:\r\nrouter#show running-config | include crypto ikev2 fragmentation\r\ncrypto ikev2 fragmentation\r\nNote: IKEv2 fragmentation is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nThe preferred method to determine whether a device has been configured for IKEv2 is to issue the show ip sockets or show udp EXEC command. If the device has UDP port 500 or UDP port 4500 open, it is processing IKE packets.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the device is processing IKE packets on UDP  port 500 and UDP port 4500, using either IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP  version 6 (IPv6):\r\nrouter# show udp\r\nProto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF    17       --listen--          192.168.130.21    500   0   0 1001011   0     17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN           500   0   0 1020011   0     17       --listen--          192.168.130.21   4500   0   0 1001011   0     17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN          4500   0   0 1020011   0    .\r\n.\r\n.\r\nrouter#\r\n    Cisco IOS Software will also process IKE packets on UDP port 848 (GDOI), using either IPv4 or IPv6, when the G-IKEv2 feature for GETVPN has been enabled.\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software Version\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the command-line interface, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The image name appears in parentheses followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\nCisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
