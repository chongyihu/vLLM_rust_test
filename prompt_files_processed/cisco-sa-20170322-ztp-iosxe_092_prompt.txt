An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted DHCP packet to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 22, 2017, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes five Cisco Security Advisories that describe five vulnerabilities. All the vulnerabilities have a Security Impact Rating of High. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2017 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-60851\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Routers that are running an affected release of Cisco IOS XE Software and are listening on the DHCP server port. By default, the devices do not listen on the DHCP server port.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a device is listening on the DHCP server port, use the show ip sockets privileged EXEC command on the device. The following example shows the output of the show ip sockets command on a Cisco IOS XE device configured as a DHCP server and/or a DHCP relay agent. The Port 67 output confirms that the device is listening for DHCP server packets:\r\n\r\n\r\nASR920# show ip sockets\r\nProto        Remote      Port    Local        Port   In  Out  Stat  TTY OutputIF   17          0.0.0.0       0     192.168.0.1  18999  0   0      11   0    17          0.0.0.0       0     --any--      67     0   0   22211   0   ASR920#\r\n    Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears.
