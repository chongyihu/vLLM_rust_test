An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted UDP packets to a specific port on an affected device. A successful exploit could either allow the attacker to tear down the connection between the AP and the wireless LAN controller, resulting in the affected device not being able to process client traffic, or cause the vulnerable device to reload, triggering a DoS condition. After the attack, the affected device should automatically recover its normal functions without manual intervention.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable software release:\r\n\r\nAironet 1540 Series APs\r\nAironet 1560 Series APs\r\nAironet 1800 Series APs\r\nAironet 2800 Series APs\r\nAironet 3800 Series APs\r\nAironet 4800 APs\r\nBusiness 100 Series APs and Mesh Extenders\r\nBusiness 200 Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9100 APs\r\nCatalyst IW 6300 APs\r\nESW6300 Series APs\r\nIntegrated Access Point on 1100 Integrated Services Routers\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: For Cisco Catalyst 9100 APs, Release 8.9.100.0 is the first supported release.\r\n\r\nFor information about which software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable\', \'text\': \'Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Details\', \'text\': \'The vulnerability described in this advisory presents two different nuances. The exploit techniques and attack vectors are almost identical, and the fixed code addresses both of them. In this section, administrators can find additional details about these two security issues:\r\n\r\nCSCvr85614 can be exploited by an attacker connected over the network, targeting any AP regardless of its deployment mode. Exploiting this vulnerability would cause the targeted AP to lose the connection to its controller, which could lead to client network loss or radio resets, depending on the configuration. The AP should recover on its own when the attack stops.\r\nCSCvr85609 can also be exploited by an attacker connected over the network and is also independent of the AP deployment mode. Exploiting this vulnerability would cause the AP to unexpectedly reload. The device should recover automatically after a few minutes without manual intervention.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Workarounds\', \'text\': \'There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Fixed Software\', \'text\': \'Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory.
