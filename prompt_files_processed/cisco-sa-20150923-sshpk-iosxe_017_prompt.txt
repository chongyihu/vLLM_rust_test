You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n

Expected Output Format:\n    The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\n    As an example, for the schema {{\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}} the object {{\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {{\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\n    Here is the output schema:\n\n    ```\n    {\"$defs\": {\"ReasonDetail\": {\"properties\": {\"detailed_explanation\": {\"description\": \"An in-depth explanation of why the device was flagged as vulnerable, including references to requirement documents and analysis of the specific snapshots from the device output, offering a personalized rationale to enhance user confidence in the LLM\'s assessment.\", \"title\": \"Detailed Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"relevant_device_output\": {\"description\": \"Extracted lines from the device output (+/- 2-3 lines) that contributed to the vulnerability decision, allowing the user to review the exact context.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Relevant Device Output\", \"type\": \"array\"}}, \"required\": [\"detailed_explanation\", \"relevant_device_output\"], \"title\": \"ReasonDetail\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"properties\": {\"is_vulnerable\": {\"description\": \"Indicates if the device is vulnerable (True) or not (False)\", \"title\": \"Is Vulnerable\", \"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"reason\": {\"description\": \"Explanation of why the device is flagged as vulnerable or not.\", \"title\": \"Reason\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"reason_detail\": {\"$ref\": \"#/$defs/ReasonDetail\", \"description\": \"A structured, detailed explanation of the vulnerability status, including contextual insights and specific device output lines.\"}, \"mitigation_step\": {\"description\": \"Recommended steps to mitigate the identified vulnerability based on the Requirement Document and device output.\", \"title\": \"Mitigation Step\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"is_vulnerable\", \"reason\", \"reason_detail\", \"mitigation_step\"]}\n    ```

Requirement Document: {\'category\': \'Cisco Security Advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the SSH version 2 (SSHv2) protocol implementation  of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an\r\nunauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass user authentication. \n\r\n\n\r\nSuccessful exploitation could allow the attacker to log in with the privileges of the user or the privileges configured for the Virtual Teletype (VTY) line. Depending on the configuration of the user and of the vty line, the attacker may obtain administrative privileges on the system. The attacker cannot use this vulnerability to elevate privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe attacker must know a valid username configured for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA)-based user authentication and the public key configured for that user to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability\r\naffects only devices configured for public key authentication method, also known as an RSA-based user authentication feature. \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds for this vulnerability are not available; however administrators could temporarily disable RSA-based user authentication to avoid exploitation.

An attacker could exploit this\r\nvulnerability by authenticating to an affected system configured\r\nfor SSHv2 RSA-based user authentication using a crafted private key. The attacker must know a valid username configured for RSA-based user\r\nauthentication and the public key configured for that user to exploit\r\nthis vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nA successful exploit could\r\nallow the attacker to bypass user authentication and log in with the privileges of the user or with the privileges configured for the virtual teletype (VTY) line.
