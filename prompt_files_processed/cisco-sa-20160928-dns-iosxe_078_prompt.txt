You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n

Expected Output Format:\n    The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\n    As an example, for the schema {{\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}} the object {{\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was reported to Cisco during the resolution of support cases.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the DNS forwarder functionality of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload, corrupt the information present in the device\\'s local DNS cache, or read part of the process memory.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a flaw in handling crafted DNS response messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting and crafting a DNS response message to a client DNS query that was forwarded from the affected device to a DNS server. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition or corruption of the local DNS cache information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 28, 2016, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 10 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 11 vulnerabilities. All the vulnerabilities have a Security Impact Rating of High. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2016 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-56513\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects products running a  vulnerable release of  Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software. For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nDevices running a vulnerable release of code are affected if the IP DNS server functionality is enabled. The DNS server functionality is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo verify whether a device is configured for DNS server functionality, use the show running-config | include ip dns server command and verify that the functionality is present. The following example shows a Cisco IOS router with DNS server functionality enabled:\r\nrouter#show running-config | include ip dns server\r\nip dns server\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the command-line interface (CLI), and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\nCisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n                          Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (First Fixed). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (Combined First Fixed).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software releasefor example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.1.4Sin the following field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032\"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754\"], or Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252\"], depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerability Policy\', \'text\': \'To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html\"].
