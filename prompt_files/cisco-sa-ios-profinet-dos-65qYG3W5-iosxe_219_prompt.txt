You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the PROFINET handler for Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) messages of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a crash on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of LLDP messages in the PROFINET LLDP message handler. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious LLDP message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA companion advisory for affected devices that support PROFINET is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-profinet-J9QMCHPB [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-profinet-J9QMCHPB\"].\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 24, 2020, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 25 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 34 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2020 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74268\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects Cisco Industrial Ethernet devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software and have the PROFINET feature enabled. The PROFINET feature is enabled by default on platforms that support it.\r\n\r\nThe following Cisco products support PROFINET:\r\n\r\nCatalyst IE3200 Rugged Switches\r\nCatalyst IE3300 Rugged Switches\r\nCatalyst IE3400 Heavy Switches\r\nCatalyst IE3400 Rugged Switches\r\nEmbedded Services 2020 Series Switches\r\nEmbedded Services 3300 Series Switches\r\nIndustrial Ethernet 2000 Series Switches\r\nIndustrial Ethernet 2000U Series Switches\r\nIndustrial Ethernet 3000 Series Switches\r\nIndustrial Ethernet 4000 Series Switches\r\nIndustrial Ethernet 4010 Series Switches\r\nIndustrial Ethernet 5000 Series Switches\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determine the Device Configuration  Option 1: show profinet status\r\nTo determine whether PROFINET is enabled on a device, use the show profinet status command and check the State that is reported in the output. If the command returns a state of Enabled, the PROFINET feature is enabled and the device is vulnerable. If the command returns a state of Disabled or if the command does not exist, the PROFINET feature is not enabled and the device is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show profinet status command on a device that has the PROFINET feature enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitch#show profinet status\r\nState       : Enabled\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\n  Option 2: show running-config all\r\nAlternatively, use the show running-config all | include profinet command and look for an output line that contains only the word profinet. If the line is present, the PROFINET feature is enabled and the device is vulnerable. If profinet is not present alone on an output line, the PROFINET feature is not enabled and the device is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show running-config all | include profinet command on a device that has the PROFINET feature enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitch#show running-config all | include profinet\r\nprofinet\r\nprofinet mrp\r\nprofinet vlan 1\r\nno profinet id\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable\', \'text\': \'Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Workarounds\', \'text\': \'There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nHowever, customers who do not use the PROFINET feature can disable it by using the no profinet command in global configuration mode, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitch#conf t\r\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\r\nSwitch(config)#no profinet\r\nSwitch(config)#^Z\r\nSwitch#show profinet status\r\nState       : Disabled\r\nVlan        : 1\r\nId          :\r\nConnected   : No\r\nReductRatio : 128\r\n\r\nSwitch#conf t\r\n\r\nNote: Disabling LLDP only is not a viable option because LLDP is required for proper PROFINET operation. Running PROFINET without LLDP is not supported, and PROFINET will force LLDP to start each time the device is reloaded, even if not configured specifically.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Fixed Software\', \'text\': \'Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (First Fixed). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (Combined First Fixed).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software releasefor example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.\r\n\r\nFor a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032\"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754\"], or Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252\"], depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerability Policy\', \'text\': \'To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html\"].
