If the command returns any output, IKEv1 fragmentation is enabled, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter#show running-config | include crypto isakmp fragmentation\r\ncrypto isakmp fragmentation\r\n\r\nDetermine the Device IKEv1 Configuration\r\n\r\nFeatures that use IKEv1 include different types of VPNs, such as the following:\r\n\r\nDynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)\r\nFlexVPN\r\nGroup Encrypted Transport VPN (GET VPN)\r\nLAN-to-LAN VPN\r\nRemote access VPN (excluding SSLVPN)\r\n\r\nThe preferred method to determine whether a device has been configured for IKEv1 is to use the show ip sockets or show udp EXEC command. If the device has UDP port 500, UDP port 4500, or UDP port 848 (GDOI) open, it is processing IKEv1 packets.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show udp command on a device that is processing IKEv1 packets on UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500, using either IPv4 or IPv6:\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter# show udp\r\nProto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF\r\n17        --listen--          192.168.130.21    500   0   0 1001011   0\r\n17(v6)    --listen--          UNKNOWN           500   0   0 1020011   0\r\n17        --listen--          192.168.130.21   4500   0   0 1001011   0\r\n17(v6)    --listen--          UNKNOWN          4500   0   0 1020011   0\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nrouter#\r\n\r\nDetermine the Buffers Huge Configuration (Required for CVE-2024-20307 Only)\r\n\r\nTo determine if the buffers huge size has been altered from the default value, use the show running-config | include buffers huge command and verify that it returns output.
