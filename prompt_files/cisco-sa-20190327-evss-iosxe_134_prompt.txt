You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the Easy Virtual Switching System (VSS) of Cisco IOS XE Software on Catalyst 4500 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the switches to reload.\r\n\r\n  The vulnerability is due to incomplete error handling when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) packets used with the Easy Virtual Switching System. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted CDP packet. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-evss [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-evss\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 27, 2019, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 17 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 19 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2019 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-71135\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 4500/4500X Series Switches that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software and have CDP enabled.\r\n\r\nFor information about which software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nThere are two different configurations where the switch is vulnerable:\r\n\r\nCisco Catalyst 4500/4500X Series device has CDP enabled with CDP Application TLVs.\r\nWhen an admin is converting the switches\\' configuration from standalone mode to virtual switch mode using easy virtual switching.\r\n\r\nDetermining if CDP Is Enabled\r\n\r\nTo determine whether use of the Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled for a device, administrators can use the show cdp command in the device CLI. The output of the command displays global Cisco Discovery Protocol information or, if the protocol is disabled, indicates that use of the protocol is not enabled. Examples of both are shown as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitch#show cdp\r\nGlobal CDP information:  Sending CDP packets every 60 seconds  Sending a holdtime value of 180 seconds  Sending CDPv2 advertisements is  enabled  Switch#  Switch#show cdp  % CDP is not enabled  Switch#\r\n\r\nDetermining if CDP Application TLVs Are Enabled\r\n\r\nBy default, CDP Application TLV processing is enabled. To determine if CDP Application TLVs are disabled, administrators can issue the show running-config | include no cdp tlv app CLI command. If the output returns nothing, then processing of CDP Application TLVs is enabled. If it returns output, it will indicate which interfaces have the CDP Application TLVs processing disabled, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitch#show running-config | include no cdp tlv app\r\nno cdp tlv app   no cdp tlv app   no cdp tlv app  Switch#\r\n\r\nDetermining if Admin Is Converting the Switches Configuration From Standalone Mode to Virtual Switch Mode Using Easy Virtual Switching\r\n\r\nWhen an admin issues the switch convert mode easy-virtual-switch exec command on a device, it commences configuring the switches to operate as a VSS. Once the configuration has completed, the switches will reload. Part of this process is that UDP port 5500 is opened until the switches reload. During this period, it is possible to remotely exploit this vulnerability. Once the system reloads as a VSS, only the adjacent vector is available.\r\n  Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nios-xe-device# show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Disabling CDP Application TLVs will mitigate this vulnerability. To disable use of CDP Application TLVs globally for a device, use the no cdp tlv app command in the global configuration CLI. To disable use of CDP Application TLVs for a specific interface of a device, use the no cdp tlv app command in the interface configuration CLI.\r\n\r\nTo see if CDP Application TLVs are in use on the device before disabling them, use the command show cdp tlv app.  If the command returns output, then it is advisable not to disable the CDP TLV App globally.\r\n\r\nDisabling CDP\r\n\r\nIf CDP is not required, administrators may disable use of the Cisco Discovery Protocol by a device. To disable use of the protocol globally for a device, use the no cdp run command in the global configuration CLI. To disable use of the protocol for a specific interface of a device, use the no cdp enable command in the interface configuration CLI.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Fixed Software\', \'text\': \'Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory.
