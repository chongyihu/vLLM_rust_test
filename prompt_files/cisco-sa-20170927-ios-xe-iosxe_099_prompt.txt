You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a support case.\'}], \'category\': \'Cisco Security Advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the wireless controller manager of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a restart of the switch and result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted association request. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to restart.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170927-ios-xe [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170927-ios-xe\"]\', \'title\': \'Summary\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 3650 and 3850 switches running IOS XE Software versions 16.1 through 16.3.3, and acting as wireless LAN controllers (WLC). For information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS XE Software or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.16.1aS:\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software, Version 03.16.01a.S - Extended Support Release\r\nCisco IOS Software, ASR1000 Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.5(3)S1a, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Wed 04-Nov-15 17:40 by mcpre\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html\"].\r\n  To determine if the device is acting as a WLC, administrators can log in to the device and use the show wireless interface summary command in the CLI, and then refer to the command output that appears.
