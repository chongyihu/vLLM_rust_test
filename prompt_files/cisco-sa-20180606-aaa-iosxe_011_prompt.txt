You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) security services of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect memory operations that the affected software performs when the software parses a username during login authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device or cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-aaa [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-aaa\"]\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release Fuji 16.7.1 or Fuji 16.8.1 and are configured to use AAA for login authentication.\r\n  Checking the AAA Configuration\r\nTo determine whether a device is configured to use AAA for login authentication, administrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include aaa authentication login command in the CLI, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | include aaa authentication login\r\n  aaa authentication login default local  Router#\r\n\r\nIf the device is configured to use AAA for login authentication, the output of the command will include the aaa authentication login command and the configuration values for the name of the authentication list (default in the preceding example) and the authentication method (local in the preceding example).\r\n\r\nIf the show running-config | include aaa authentication login command does not return any output, the device is not configured to use AAA for login authentication.\r\n  Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears.

However, administrators may limit the exposure of a device by limiting administration sessions to the device.\r\n\r\nBy applying a vty access class that permits only known, trusted devices to connect to the device, administrators can help ensure that only trusted sources can access a device via vty.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a vty access class that permits vty access to a device from the 192.168.1.0/24 netblock and the IP address 172.16.1.2, and denies vty access from everywhere else:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255\r\nRouter(config)# access-list 1 permit host 172.16.1.2  Router(config)# line vty 0 4  Router(config-line)# access-class 1 in\r\n\r\nFor console ports or auxiliary ports that are connected via a terminal server connection, ensure that the vty access class is configured on the terminal server. For console ports or auxiliary ports that are not connected or not used, issue the no exec command on the line to prevent access to that port, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter(config)# line aux 0\r\nRouter(config-line)# no exec\r\n\r\nBecause different Cisco platforms support different numbers of terminal lines, administrators should check the device configuration to determine the correct number of terminal lines for the platform.\r\n\r\nFor detailed information about restricting traffic to a device via a vty line, see the Telnet, Console and AUX Port Passwords on Cisco Routers Configuration Example [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ios-nx-os-software/ios-software-releases-110/45843-configpasswords.html\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Fixed Software\', \'text\': \'Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in Cisco IOS XE Software Releases Fuji 16.7.2, Fuji 16.8.1c, and Fuji 16.8.1s.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability will be fixed in Cisco IOS XE Software Release Fuji 16.9.1, which is expected to be released in July 2018, and Cisco IOS XE Software Release Fuji 16.8.2, which is expected to be released in September 2018.\r\n  Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (First Fixed). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (Combined First Fixed).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software releasefor example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.1.4Sin the following field:\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerability Policy\', \'text\': \'To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html\"].
