You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'Two vulnerabilities in the IPv6 first hop security feature of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds to mitigate these vulnerabilities.  \r\n\r\nNote: The September 23, 2015, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes three Cisco Security Advisories. All the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. Individual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: September 2015 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep15.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep15.html\"]\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Affected Products\', \'text\': \'These  vulnerabilities affect products running Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE  Software.

If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\nCisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

IPv6 ND inspection operates either at Layer  2, or between Layer 2 and Layer 3 to provide IPv6 features with  security and scalability.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS and IOS XE Software that is configured to use the IPv6 snooping feature is affected by the following two vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\nCisco IOS and IOS XE Software IPv6 Snooping Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of IPv6 ND packets that use the Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) option. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed packet to an affected device where the IPv6 Snooping feature is enabled.\r\n\r\nThis  vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuo04400 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuo04400\"] (registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and  Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6279.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS and IOS XE Software IPv6 Snooping Secure Network Discovery Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the IPv6 snooping feature from the first-hop security features in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient Control Plane Protection (CPPr) against specific IPv6 ND packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of traffic consisting of specific IPv6 ND packets to an affected device where the IPv6 snooping feature is configured.\r\n\r\nThis  vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus19794 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus19794\"] (registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and  Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6278\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Workarounds\', \'text\': \'There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nAdministrators may disable the IPv6 snooping feature on an affected device until the device is upgraded to a nonvulnerable release.\r\n\r\nTo disable IPv6 snooping use the no ipv6 snooping command in the interface configuration mode for each interface where the feature has been configured.\r\n\r\nTo verify that the feature was disabled, use the show running-config | include ipv6 snooping command or the show ipv6 snooping policies command.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a Cisco IOS device with IPv6 snooping disabled:\r\nrouter#show ipv6 snooping policies\r\nTarget               Type  Policy               Feature        Target range\r\nrouter#\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Fixed Software\', \'text\': \'When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt [\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n                          Cisco IOS Software\r\nCisco provides a tool to help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] allows customers to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system\r\nEnter show version command output for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nThe tool identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory (\"First Fixed\"). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories (\"Combined First Fixed\"). Please visit the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] or enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether the release is affected by any published Cisco IOS Software advisory.\r\n\r\n(Example entry: 15.1(4)M2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032\"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754\"], and Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252\"].\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software is affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### Bugs: Single: CSCuo04400 CSCus19794, Bundle: CSCus19794 CSCuo04400 CSCus73013 CSCut96933 ### -->  <!-- ### Date: 2015-09-16 20:37:23.464745 ### -->                                              Cisco\r\nIOS XE\r\nSoftware\r\nTrain                              First Fixed Release for\r\nthis Advisory                             First Fixed Release for\r\nAll Advisories in the\r\nSeptember 2015 Cisco IOS and IOS XE\r\nSoftware Security Advisory\r\nBundled Publication                                    2.6                Not vulnerable                Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later.                                    3.1S                Not vulnerable                Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later.                                    3.1SG                Not vulnerable                Not vulnerable                                    3.2S                Not vulnerable                Vulnerable; migrate to 3.10.6S or later.                                    3.2SE                Vulnerable; migrate to 3.6.3E or later.
