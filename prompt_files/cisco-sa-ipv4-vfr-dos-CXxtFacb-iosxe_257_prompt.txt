You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the implementation of the IPv4 Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly (VFR) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper reassembly of large packets that occurs when VFR is enabled on either a tunnel interface or on a physical interface that is configured with a maximum transmission unit (MTU) greater than 4,615 bytes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented packets through a VFR-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 2023 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2023 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74842\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software and have the VFR feature enabled:\r\n\r\n1000 Series Integrated Services Routers\r\n4000 Series Integrated Services Routers\r\nCatalyst 8000V Edge Software Routers\r\nCatalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms\r\nCatalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms\r\nCatalyst 8500L Series Edge Platforms\r\nCloud Services Router 1000V Series\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determine the Device Configuration\r\nTo determine whether a device is configured for a non-default MTU, use the show running-config | include interface | mtu CLI command. If the MTU has been changed, this command will return mtu under the enabled interfaces, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | include interface | mtu\r\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0/1\r\nmtu 9000\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the VFR feature is enabled, use the show ip virtual-reassembly CLI command, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show ip virtual-reassembly\r\nGigabitEthernet0/0/1:\r\n   Virtual Fragment Reassembly (VFR) is ENABLED [in]\r\n   Concurrent reassemblies (max-reassemblies): 16\r\n   Fragments per reassembly (max-fragments): 32\r\n   Reassembly timeout (timeout): 3 seconds\r\n   Drop fragments: OFF\r\n\r\n[Output omitted for readability]\r\n\r\nTunnel1:\r\n   Virtual Fragment Reassembly (VFR) is ENABLED [in]\r\n   Concurrent reassemblies (max-reassemblies): 16\r\n   Fragments per reassembly (max-fragments): 32\r\n   Reassembly timeout (timeout): 3 seconds\r\n   Drop fragments: OFF\r\n\r\nIn these two examples, the physical interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1 has an MTU configured at greater than 4,615 bytes and has the VFR feature enabled. This means the interface is affected by this vulnerability. Interface Tunnel1, which has VFR enabled with the default MTU, is also affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: VFR is automatically enabled by features such as Network Address Translation (NAT), Zone-Based Firewall, and IPSec to process Layer 4 or Layer 7 information. Disabling VFR is not recommended. The configuration command ip virtual-reassembly will not be displayed in the output of show running-config unless the VFR feature was manually enabled.

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner.
