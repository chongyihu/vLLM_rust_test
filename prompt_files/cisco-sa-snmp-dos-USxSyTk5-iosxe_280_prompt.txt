You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software on Catalyst 4500 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when the software processes specific SNMP object identifiers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability by using SNMPv2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability by using SNMPv3, the attacker must know the user credentials for the affected system.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snmp-dos-USxSyTk5 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snmp-dos-USxSyTk5\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the June 3, 2020, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 23 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 25 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: June 2020 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\" https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-73388\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switches that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software, are configured for SNMP polling, and have Power over Ethernet (PoE) line-card modules installed.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Assess the SNMP Configuration\r\nTo determine whether a device is configured for SNMP, administrators can use the show run | include snmp command in the CLI. If any output is returned, SNMP is enabled on the device. The following example shows the output of the show run | include snmp command on a device that is configured with both read-only and read-write community strings:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show run | include snmp\r\n  snmp-server community public RO  snmp-server community write RW\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable\', \'text\': \'Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Details\', \'text\': \'An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device by using IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic that is directed to an affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability by using SNMPv2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for an affected system. A community string is a password that is applied to a device to restrict both read-only and read-write access to SNMP data on a device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be chosen carefully to ensure that they are not trivial. They should be changed at regular intervals. They should also be changed in accordance with network security policies, such as when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the organization.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability by using SNMPv3, the attacker must know the user credentials for an affected system.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Workarounds\', \'text\': \'There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nHowever, administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling the affected MIB, in this case CISCO-POWER-ETHERNET-EXT-MIB. To create or update a view entry and disable CISCO-POWER-ETHERNET-EXT-MIB, administrators can log in to the device and use the snmp-server view global configuration command in the CLI, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nsnmp-server view SNMP_VIEW_NAME ciscoPowerEthernetExtMIB excluded\r\n\r\nTo apply the configuration to an SNMPv2 community string, administrators can use the following command:\r\n\r\n\r\nsnmp-server community mycomm view SNMP_VIEW_NAME RO\r\n\r\nTo apply the configuration to an SNMPv3 community string, administrators can use the following command:\r\n\r\n\r\nsnmp-server group v3group v3 auth read SNMP_VIEW_NAME write SNMP_VIEW_NAME\r\n\r\n\r\n  SNMP Access Control List\r\nAdministrators can reduce the attack surface by using an access control list (ACL) to restrict SNMP queries from specific IP addresses. However, administrators are advised to also use Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF).\r\n\r\nSince the vulnerable feature uses UDP as a transport, an attacker could spoof the IP address and bypass an ACL that permits communication to these UDP ports from trusted IP addresses. The following is an example of an ACL that allows only hosts at 192.0.2.1 to query the device with SNMP requests:\r\n\r\n\r\naccess-list 1 permit 192.0.2.1\r\nsnmp-server community example RO 1\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Fixed Software\', \'text\': \'Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.
