You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during internal security testing.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform an injection attack against an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary Cisco IOS XE Software CLI commands with level 15 privileges.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability is exploitable only if the attacker obtains the credentials for a Lobby Ambassador account. This account is not configured by default.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 2023 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2023 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74916\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software, have a Lobby Ambassador account enabled, and have the HTTP server feature enabled:\r\n\r\nCatalyst 9300 Series Switches\r\nCatalyst 9400 Series Switches\r\nCatalyst 9500 Series Switches\r\nCatalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controllers for Cloud\r\nCatalyst 9800 Embedded Wireless Controller for Catalyst 9300, 9400, and 9500 Series Switches\r\nEmbedded Wireless Controller on Catalyst 9100X Series Access Points\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determine the Device Configuration\r\nTo determine whether Lobby Ambassador accounts and the HTTP server feature are configured on a device, use the following instructions.\r\n\r\nDetermine the Lobby Ambassador Account Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine how many Lobby Ambassador accounts are configured on a device, log in to the device and run the show running-config | count type lobby-admin CLI command. The following example shows the CLI output on a device with one Lobby Ambassador account configured:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | count type lobby-admin\r\nNumber of lines which match regexp = 1\r\n\r\nThe number at the end of the line indicates how many Lobby Ambassador accounts are configured on the device.\r\n\r\nNote: The Lobby Ambassador role can be associated with a user account using RADIUS or TACACS+. Customers who are using an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server such as Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to manage user accounts accessing their device should check for the presence of users that have the cisco-av-pair=lobby-admin attribute set. For an example of how to configure a Lobby Ambassador account on Cisco ISE, see Configure 9800 WLC Lobby Ambassador with RADIUS and TACACS+ Authentication [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/215552-9800-wlc-lobby-ambassador-with-radius-an.html\"].\r\n\r\nDetermine the HTTP Server Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the HTTP Server feature is enabled for a device, log in to the device and use the show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active command in the CLI to check for the presence of the ip http server command or the ip http secure-server command in the global configuration. If either command is present, the HTTP Server feature is enabled for the device.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active command for a device that has the HTTP Server feature enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active\r\nip http server\r\nip http secure-server\r\n\r\nNote: The presence of either command or both commands in the device configuration indicates that the web UI feature is enabled.\r\n\r\nIf the ip http server command is present and the configuration also contains ip http active-session-modules none, the vulnerability is not exploitable over HTTP.\r\n\r\nIf the ip http secure-server command is present and the configuration also contains ip http secure-active-session-modules none, the vulnerability is not exploitable over HTTPS.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software is affected by this vulnerability only if the device is configured with a Lobby Ambassador account. This is not a default configuration and must be added by an administrator.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable\', \'text\': \'Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\nIOS Software\r\nIOS XR Software\r\nMeraki products\r\nNX-OS Software\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Workarounds\', \'text\': \'There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nHowever, administrators may disable the Lobby Ambassador account, eliminating the attack vector for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nWhile this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Fixed Software\', \'text\': \'Cisco has released free software updates [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu\"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads.
