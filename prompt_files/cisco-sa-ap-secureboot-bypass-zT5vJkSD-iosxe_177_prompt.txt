You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during internal security testing.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the boot process of Cisco Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker to bypass the Cisco Secure Boot functionality and load a software image that has been tampered with on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because unnecessary commands are available during boot time at the physical console. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by interrupting the boot process and executing specific commands to bypass the Cisco Secure Boot validation checks and load an image that has been tampered with. This image would have been previously downloaded onto the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to load the image once. The Cisco Secure Boot functionality is not permanently compromised.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable software release:\r\n\r\n\r\n6300 Series Embedded Services APs\r\n\r\nAironet 1540 Series APs\r\n\r\nAironet 1560 Series APs\r\nAironet 1800 Series APs\r\nAironet 2800 Series APs\r\nAironet 3800 Series APs\r\nAironet 4800 APs\r\nBusiness 100 Series APs and Mesh Extenders\r\nBusiness 200 Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9105AX Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9115 Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9120AX Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9124AX Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9130AX Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9136 Series APs\r\n\r\nCatalyst Cellular Gateways\r\nCatalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Series APs\r\nWide Pluggable Form Factor Wi-Fi 6 AP Module for Industrial Routers\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable\', \'text\': \'Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\n\r\nAironet 1530 Series APs\r\n\r\nAironet 1550 Series APs\r\nAironet 1570 Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9162 Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9164 Series APs\r\nCatalyst 9166 Series APs\r\nIOS XR Software\r\nMeraki products\r\nNX-OS Software\r\nSmall Business Wireless APs\r\nWireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software\r\n\r\nCisco has also confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect any Cisco AP series that is not listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Workarounds\', \'text\': \'There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Fixed Software\', \'text\': \'Cisco has released free software updates [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu\"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.
