You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'These vulnerabilities were discovered during the investigation of customer cases by the Cisco TAC.\r\n\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'Multiple vulnerabilities in the multicast subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition. The issues are in IPv4 Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) and IPv6 Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM).\n\r\n\n\r\nThe first vulnerability (Cisco bug ID CSCud36767[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud36767\"] (registered[\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)) is due to insufficient checking of MSDP Source-Active (SA) messages received from a configured MSDP peer. An attacker who can send traffic to the IPv4 address of a device could exploit this vulnerability by sending a packet designed to trigger the issue to the affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to restart.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe second vulnerability (Cisco bug ID CSCuy16399[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuy16399\"] (registered[\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only))\xa0is due to insufficient checking of packets encapsulated in a PIM register message. An attacker who can send a malformed IPv6 PIM register packet to a PIM rendezvous point (RP) could exploit the vulnerability. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to restart.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 28, 2016, release of the Cisco\xa0IOS and IOS\xa0XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 10 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 11 vulnerabilities. All the vulnerabilities have a Security Impact Rating of High. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2016 Semiannual Cisco\xa0IOS and IOS\xa0XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication[\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-56513\"].\n\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices running affected Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases only when affected devices are configured for interdomain MSDP or IPv6 multicast routing.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software[\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether the MSDP feature is enabled, use the show running-config | include ip msdp peer command and verify that it returns output.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows a device running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software with MSDP enabled:\n\r\n\r\nrouter#show running-config | include ip msdp peer\r\nip msdp peer 10.55.116.26\nip msdp peer 3.3.3.3 connect-source Loopback0\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the IPv6 multicast routing feature is enabled, use the show running-config | include ipv6 multicast-routing command and verify that it returns output.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows a device running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software with IPv6 multicast routing enabled:\n\r\n\r\nrouter#show running-config | include ipv6 multicast-routing\r\nipv6 multicast-routing\r\n\r\n\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco\xa0IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the command-line interface (CLI), and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco\xa0IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco\xa0Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco\xa0IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco\xa0IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco\xa0IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco\xa0IOS Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"].\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco\xa0IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears.
