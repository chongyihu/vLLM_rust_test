You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the DHCP snooping security feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a full interface queue wedge, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of DHCP request packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending DHCP request packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause packets to wedge in the queue, creating a DoS condition for downstream devices of the affected system and requiring that the system restart to drain the queue.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability can be exploited with either unicast or broadcast DHCP packets on a VLAN that does not have DHCP snooping enabled.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the May 2025 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

The following example shows how to set the value to 350 by using the hold-queue in interface configuration command:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# configure terminal\r\nRouter(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 1\r\nRouter(config-if)# hold-queue 350 in\r\n\r\nMonitor and Detect Queue Wedges with Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager\r\n\r\nTo monitor and detect interface queue wedges that are caused by this vulnerability, administrators can use a Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl). This policy would allow administrators to monitor interfaces for devices that are running Cisco IOS XE Software and detect when input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy sends an alert to the network administrator, who can then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations, or reload the device to clear the input queue.\r\n\r\nThe Tcl script is available for download at Interface Input Queue Monitor [\"https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Indicators of Compromise\', \'text\': \'To identify an affected interface, run the following commands:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show interfaces | include line|Input\r\nGigabitEthernet1 is up, line protocol is up\r\nInput queue: 376/375/0/0 (size/max/drops/flushes); Total output drops: 0\r\n\r\nAn input queue is wedged when the size value is greater than the max value.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Workarounds\', \'text\': \'There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.
