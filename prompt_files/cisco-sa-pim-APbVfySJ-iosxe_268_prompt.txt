You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found by Deepika S. of Cisco during internal security testing.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of received IPv4 PIMv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PIMv2 packet to a PIM-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability can be exploited with either an IPv4 multicast or unicast packet.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 2024 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75169\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 17.13.1 or 17.13.1a and have PIM configured.\r\n\r\nNote: IPv6 PIM is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determine the Device Configuration\r\nTo determine whether a device has PIM enabled, log in to the device and use the show running-config | include ip pim sparse- CLI command. If the command returns ip pim sparse-mode or ip pim sparse-dense-mode, the device is affected by this vulnerability, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | include ip pim sparse-\r\nip pim sparse-mode\r\nRouter#\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable\', \'text\': \'Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\nIOS Software\r\nIOS XR Software\r\nMeraki products\r\nNX-OS Software\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Workarounds\', \'text\': \'There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Fixed Software\', \'text\': \'Cisco has released free software updates [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu\"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n        Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"]. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (First Fixed). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (Combined First Fixed).\r\n\r\nTo use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory. To use the form, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nChoose which advisories the tool will searchonly this advisory, only advisories with a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR) [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr\"], or all advisories.\r\nEnter a release numberfor example, 15.9(3)M2 or 17.3.3.\r\nClick Check.\r\n\r\n       Only this advisory  All Critical and High advisories  All advisories\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerability Policy\', \'text\': \'To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy [\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html\"].
