You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found by X.B. of the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG) during internal security testing.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the Out-of-Band Access Point (AP) Image Download, the Clean Air Spectral Recording, and the client debug bundles features of Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the presence of a hard-coded JSON Web Token (JWT) on an affected system.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS requests to the AP file upload interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files, perform path traversal, and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the May 2025 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: May 2025 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75279\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software for WLCs, regardless of device configuration.\r\n\r\nCatalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controllers for Cloud\r\nCatalyst 9800 Embedded Wireless Controller for Catalyst 9300, 9400, and 9500 Series Switches\r\nCatalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers\r\nEmbedded Wireless Controller on Catalyst APs\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable\', \'text\': \'Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\nIOS Software\r\nIOS XE Software running on devices that are not functioning as WLCs and not listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"https://wiki.cisco.com/display/CASP/IOS+and+IOS+XE+Bundle+March+2025?src=contextnavpagetreemode#vp\"] section of this advisory\r\nIOS XR Software\r\nMeraki products\r\nNX-OS Software\r\nWLC AireOS Software\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Workarounds\', \'text\': \'There are two mitigations that are preferred for addressing this vulnerability for the two possible device configurations:\r\n  Impacted Features Not in Use\r\nIf the impacted features are not used, apply infrastructure access control lists (iACLs) to all interfaces and block the interface completely, as shown in the following example. This will completely mitigate the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nwlc# show ap file-transfer https summary\r\nConfigured port : 8443  Operational port : 8443    wlc# show ip access-lists CVE-2025-20188    10 deny tcp any any eq 8443    20 permit ip any any\r\n  Impacted Features in Use\r\nIf the impacted features are used, to reduce the attack surface, apply iACLs to limit the AP file upload interface to the WLC to allow traffic from expected sources only. The following is an iACL example that can be included as part of the deployed iACL:\r\n\r\nwlc# show ap file-transfer https summary\r\nConfigured port : 8443  Operational port : 8443    wlc# show ip access-lists CVE-2025-20188    10 deny tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD eq 8443    20 permit ip any any\r\n\r\nFor more guidelines and recommendations for deployment techniques for iACLs, see the white paper Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/43920-iacl.html\"].\r\n\r\nThere is also a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nManually triggering the AP client debug bundle once, as shown in the following example, will protect all affected features that use the AP file upload interface. Note that this workaround does not persist through reload and must be done any time the device is reloaded.\r\n\r\n!
