You are a Cisco security and networking expert. Analyze the device output from a Cisco device and determine whether the device is vulnerable based on the conditions and details outlined in the requirement document.  If the device is vulnerable, explain exactly why.\n\n    Requirement Document: {\'acknowledgments\': [{\'summary\': \'This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.\'}], \'category\': \'csaf_security_advisory\', \'csaf_version\': \'2.0\', \'notes\': [{\'category\': \'summary\', \'title\': \'Summary\', \'text\': \'A vulnerability in the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) offload implementation of Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst 4500-X Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the iosd process, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when the BFD header in a BFD packet is incomplete. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BFD message to or across an affected switch. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2018 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-66682\"].\'}, {\'category\': \'general\', \'title\': \'Vulnerable Products\', \'text\': \'This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and the BFD feature is enabled:\r\n\r\nCatalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 6-E (K5)1\r\nCatalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 6L-E (K5)1\r\nCatalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 7-E (K10)2\r\nCatalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 7L-E (K10)2\r\nCatalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 8-E (K10)3\r\nCatalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 8L-E (K10)4\r\nCatalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 9-E (K10)5\r\nCatalyst 4500-X Series Switches (K10)2\r\nCatalyst 4900M Switch (K5)1\r\nCatalyst 4948E[-F] Ethernet Switch (K5)1\r\n\r\n1. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS Software release 15.1(1)SG\r\n2. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.5.0E\r\n3. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.6.0E\r\n4. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.8.1E\r\n5. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.10.0E\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited only if the BFD feature is enabled on an affected device. The BFD feature is enabled by default in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software if the software is running an IP Base (ipbase) package license or a higher license. The BFD feature is not supported by a LAN Base (lanbase) package license. For more information, see LAN Base, IP Base, and Enterprise Services Image Support [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_29986-01.html#23636\"].\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determining Whether the BFD Feature Is Enabled\r\nTo determine whether the BFD feature is enabled on a device, administrators can use the show running-config | include feature bfd command in privileged EXEC mode. The following example shows the output of the show running-config | include feature bfd command on a Cisco Catalyst Switch that has the BFD feature disabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# show running-config | include feature bfd\r\n\r\nplatform module all feature bfd disable\r\nplatform module feature bfd disable\r\nplatform feature bfd disable\r\nfeature bfd disable\r\n\r\nEmpty output from the show running-config | include feature bfd command would indicate that the BFD feature is enabled.\r\n  Determining Which Package License Is Enabled\r\nTo determine which package license is enabled on a device, administrators can use the show license feature command in privileged EXEC mode. The following example shows the output of the show license feature command on a Cisco Catalyst Switch that has the IP Base (ipbase) package license enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nC4500# show license feature\r\n  Feature name        Enforcement  Evaluation  Clear Allowed  Enabled   Right...    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  entservices         true         true        true           false     true        ipbase              true         false       true           true      false       lanbase             false        false       true           false     false       internal_service    true         false       true           false     false\r\n\r\nIf a software release does not support the show license feature command, administrators can determine which package license is enabled on a device by identifying the type of software image that is currently running on the device. To identify the type of software image that is running on a device, administrators can use the show version | include image command in privileged EXEC mode. The following example shows the output of the show version | include image command on a Cisco Catalyst Switch that is running a software image that has the LAN Base (lanbase) package license enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nC4948E# show version | include image\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem image file is \"bootflash:cat4500e-lanbasek9-mz.151-2.SG3.bin\"\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
